# Image-Enhancement-and-Component-Extraction-project
Image Enhancement and Component Extraction that explores image processing techniques using Python and OpenCV, and it demonstrates how to extract components from images, enhance blurry or noisy images, and visualize processed results using matplotlib.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to enhance the quality of poor images and extract meaningful components like geometric shapes (e.g., circles) from them. The work is structured as a Jupyter Notebook and includes visual demonstrations for each processing task.


## Features

### 1. Component Extraction

- **Circle Detection**: Uses Hough Circle Transform to detect and highlight circles in an image.
- **COVID-19 Chart**: Processes a chart image for better readability and pattern observation.

### 2. Blurry Image Enhancement

- Applies sharpening filters and kernel convolutions to correct motion blur and out-of-focus effects.

###  3. Noise Removal

Denoising techniques applied to a noisy text image:
- **Median Filtering**
- **Fast Non-local Means Denoising**
- **Gaussian Filtering**
- **Bilateral Filtering**
